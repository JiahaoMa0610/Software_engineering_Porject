            <p>Hello and welcome to our store, we are awesomegroceries.com. <br>
			It is very important to do a feasibility study before starting this project.
			People nowadays in the 21st century love shopping online. 
			Having the ability to shop for groceries online is very convenient and preferable for many people who have very busy daily schedules.
			Some people concerned about shopping online for groceries are concerned because they want to know things
            like the expiration date, where the product is from, whether the product is non-GMO, etc. 
			On our website, the customers are able to know all these things before purchasing a product. 
			The aim of this website is to create a user friendly website for customers and make it easy for them to buy our products.
			We want our customers to feel like shopping on our website is just as simple as physically going to the local grocery store.
			All of our products will be safely delivered to your homes in a timely manner from our courier service. 
			The quality of our products is of the utmost importance to us. 
			We guarantee customer satisfaction or your money back. Since our grocery store is online based, 
			it is absolutely important to either build or cooperate with local transportation companies. 
			Our main products would be vegetables, meat, fruits, etc., 
			which generally have a heavier weight and bigger volume compared to other items people purchase online such as clothes. 
			Therefore, we will display the weight of every product.
            Whenever a customer adds an item to their shopping cart, it will dynamically display the current total weight and estimated delivery fee. 
			Customers will also have the option to pick up their orders at any of our nearby warehouses.<br>
			Welcome to our store and keep being awesome!</p>
